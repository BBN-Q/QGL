# Quantum Gate Language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BBN-Q/QGL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BBN-Q/QGL) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/BBN-Q/QGL/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/BBN-Q/QGL)

Quantum Gate Language (QGL) is a domain specific language embedded in python for
specifying pulse sequences.

Read the [online documentation](https://bbn-q.github.io/QGL/) and see example
usage in this [Jupyter
notebook](https://github.com/BBN-Q/QGL/blob/master/doc/QGL-demo.ipynb).

## Setup instructions

The most straightforward way to get up and running is to use the [Anaconda
Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads). This includes nearly all
the dependencies. The remaining dependencies can be installed from the terminal
or Anaconda Command Prompt on Windows.

### Python 2.7

```bash
conda install atom future
pip install watchdog
```

### Python 3.4+

```bash
conda install -c ecpy atom
cd QGL/
pip install .
```

For Python 3.6+ you may need to install watchdog from conda forge:
```
conda install -c conda-forge watchdog
conda install -c ecpy atom
cd QGL/
pip install .
```

If you'd like to use some of the built-in gate-set-tomography functionality,
you can grab the PyGSTi package during the install:
```
pip install '.[gst]'
```
If the `QGL` module is not installed, the repository path needs to be in the
`PYTHONPATH`. On Windows machines, you add/modify this environment variable by
going to System -> Advanced Settings -> Environment variables. On Mac/Linux
machines add the following line to your .bashrc or .bash_profile: ``` export
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/QGL/repo:$PYTHONPATH```

The QGL config file will be created the first time you run `import QGL` or `from QGL import *`.
